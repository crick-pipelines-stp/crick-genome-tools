    Extract the index sequence from a FASTQ read header.

    The function assumes that the index is located at the end of the header string,
    separated by spaces and colons. It extracts the portion of the header after the
    third colon in the last space-separated segment.

    Args:
        name (str): The read header from the FASTQ file. This is typically a string
                    containing metadata about the read, including the index.

    Returns:
        str: The extracted index sequence from the header.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the header is empty, None, or malformed (e.g., contains too
                    many colons in the index portion).
