# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

Activate the dev environment with:
```
. .venv/bin/activate && uv sync --group dev
```

## Agent Instructions

- Always discuss the task with the user before starting to write code.
- start with high-level design and architecture, then move to implementation details.
- Ask for clarification if the task is not clear.
- If the task is too complex, break it down into smaller tasks and implement them one by one.
- Never start writing code without a green light from the user.
- Once green lit, automatically run `pytest` after each code change to ensure tests pass.
- Highlight any API-breaking changes explicitly in commit messages or PR descriptions.

## General Principles

- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: write tests before writing implementation code.
- Use `pytest` as the test framework.
- Do not include unused code; only write what’s needed to make the current test pass.
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
- Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- If introducing a new pattern or abstraction, justify it with clear rationale (code comment or PR message).
- Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and classes.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on clarity and correctness first.
- Use comments to explain complex logic, but avoid obvious comments.
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes to describe their purpose and usage.

## Project Conventions

- The main source code lives in `asf_tools/`.
- The project a single `pyproject.toml` file for configuration.
- Use `pytest` for running tests, and ensure all tests pass before committing code.
- Use `black` and `isort` for code formatting and `ruff` for linting.

## Code Style

- Use [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) formatting.
- Use type hints in all function signatures.
- Use f-strings for string interpolation.
- Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate.
- Put new lines at the end of files.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Avoid using tabs for indentation.
- Use double quotes for strings, except for docstrings which should use triple double quotes.
- Put new lines between code above and comments below.
- Imports should only be at the top of the file, and should be grouped into standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports.

## Testing Guidelines

- All new code must be accompanied by tests.
- Structure tests in the `tests/` directory, with the file name starting with `test_`. The test directory is flat, the file names should be a mirror of the source code structure. For example `my_project/core.py` should have tests in `tests/test_core.py`.
- Put tests in a class and use `pytest` fixtures for setup and teardown.
- Write clear, descriptive test names that indicate what the test is verifying.
- Use the assert_that library for assertions to improve readability.
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test multiple scenarios in a single test function.
- Tests should be clear, concise, and isolated (no I/O or network unless mocked).
- Use setup, test and assert sections in the test code structure.

## Task end (PR Submission)

- When submitting a PR, ensure all tests pass and the code adheres to the above guidelines.
- Provide a clear description of the changes made in the PR.
- Make sure pytest runs without errors.
- Make sure the code is formatted with `black` and `isort` and linted with `ruff`.
- Make sure code coverage is sufficient (aim for 100% coverage).
